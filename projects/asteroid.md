summary: "An Asteroid-like game that I created using GameMaker and their tutorial."
---

My first introduction to game development was with the game engine, GameMaker. Through it I learned about sprites, game objects, and two distinct styles of adding functions to objects. Unfortunately, I no longer have the project but since GameMaker had its own language and I had watched the tutorial for the project, not a lot stuck with me. I only learned about the core concepts of game development and the thought process behind designing game features. However, this project had opened my eyes to see what is really going on in the background. Now, I no longer see games as an essence of magic and creative expression but a series of numbers and functions doing everything as it was intended to. We design the physics that imitates real life. Things such as gravity, acceleration, projectiles, and collision are all something that are coded, not given. This project gave me a new found respect for other game developers that learned to create games all by themselves.
