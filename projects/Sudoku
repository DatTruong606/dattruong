As a way to prepare for ICS314, I wanted to learn a bit about front-end development over the summer. This project was meant for me to get used to HTML and CSS as those were something I have never utilized before. Through it, I have learned about creating divs through JavaScript, how to connect elements between the three, and the frustation in designing with CSS.
