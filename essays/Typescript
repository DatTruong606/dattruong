## TypeScript
This is my first time working with TypeScript and it is now the 6th language I have experienced. TypeScript seem heavily influenced by C++ considering it has classes, data types, and access modifiers. So far, I like having static typing in my code, but I do not like the way it is written in TypeScript. Also, because it is just JavaScript, it has a lot more function that I have never used before, such as destructuring, default and rest parameters, promises, and many more. I hope to work with them more in the future.

I do think that TypeScript is a good programming language for developers. I have heard a lot negative things about JavaScript, especially its dynamically assigned variables. Since TypeScript acts like a layer on top of JavaScript, it can help developers catch errors before the code is run. While my web development experience is limited, I would like to think that TypeScript is one of the better language suited for this task.

## Athletic Software Engineering
Athletic software engineering works like a timed LeetCode exercise. It help us familiarize with the language and drills coding style into our head. Of course, since everyone has different solutions to the same problem, it is wrong to say that everyone will be learning and memorizing the same strategy. But for someone like me, who is not too familar with concepts like recursion, maps, and trees, it will definitely help me get comfortable with these concepts later on. Most importantly, ultilizing athletic software engineering will encourage us to develop a problem solving mindset and the be quick on our feet when confronting a new problem.

I like these practice WODs because they are not quick on the same difficulty as some LeetCode problem so it makes it less daunting to attempt. I really like this approach because it forces me to expand my pallet beyond basic coding skills. While I may not get most of these WODs correct, I will still amass experience and knowledge when coding under time constraints.
