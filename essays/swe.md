## What Did I Learn?
ICS314 was my introduction into software engineering. I had learned about coding stacks, databases, new languages, but most importantly, how to work with others in coding. There was also a lot of involvement with Github, especially for our final group project. I think a lot of these skills are fundamental to being a software engineer in the U.S. so it is important that I continue to develop these skills for the future. However, I think learning how to manage and work with databases was the most important skill I had learned in this class. Not often do I get to work with databases, especially for lower level ICS courses and projects. Therefore, when I had to work with my database extensively in my final group project, I have come to a better understanding of what it takes to be a full-stack developer and I have finally decided that this would be the path I would take as a Computer Science major.
