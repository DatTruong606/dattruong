## About Myself and Software Engineering

There any many skills that I have learned so far in computer science but there are still so much more for me to learn. For example, learning Java, C, C++, and a bit of Python made me thought that almost all langauges are the same in coding. They may have different syntaxes, functions, and libraries but in the end, they all operate the same and create the same product in the end. However, after learning HTML and CSS over the summer of 2024, it had made me realized that front-end development was something that was completely different than what I had imagined. It is geared toward designing therefore it look a lot less "functional" and more "messy."

I have heard about a full-stack developer's stack that contain more than just front-end and back-end development. In order to be a succesful web developer, a subset of software engineering, I would need to learn about databases, API(s), server management, and many others. While this class would introduce me to a few avaiable options, I need to pick up other languages and tools in order to be sufficient in the field. Also, as most software engineers work as a team, I would love to be able to work with anyone, even if I do not get along with them. This is vital to my career because in the real world, you can not ask to change partners if they are underperforming. It will be my responsibility for my work and my team.

Regarding about software engineering itself, I have more of an interest in back-end and the functional side because that is what I have learned about the most. I also think I prefer designing programs over web development because it is safer for the user and provide better flexibility for both ends. In the end, software development is a safe skill for me to learn because it is one of the most popular job position in the CS field. Other skills I want to learn that may benefit software engineering are machine learning, AI technology, and the cloud. 

I hope to learn a lot of new skills in ICS314 and obtain valuable experiences that would benefit me in my future career.
